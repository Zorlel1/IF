# Invisible Friends Character Selection

This is a first finish of a character celection for a future game about Invisible Friends.

## Description

This character celection will be used for future games and projects within my journey of Invisible Friends.

The selection will be expanded as Invisible Friends is minting and releasing more characters.

## Getting Started
